<h1>Parabolas</h1>
    <p>
        Parabolas, a member of the conic section family, is a curve formed by quadratic function y = x^2, as opposed to lines formed by y = x.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, we see parabolas with an equation of y = ax^2 + bx + c, where "a", "b", and "c" are coefficients that determine the properties of the parabola.
    </p>
    <p>
        The coefficient "a" generally determines horizontal size of the parabola, with a = 100 being narrow and a = 0.5 being wide. More importantly, if "a" is positive, then the parabola opens upward. If it is negative, then the parabola opens downward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The coefficient "b" does not affect the shape of the parabola as "a" did, but it does change the location of the vertex. Making "b" negative places the parabola to the right of the y-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
        The coefficient "c" determines the y-intercept of the parabola, which is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis.
